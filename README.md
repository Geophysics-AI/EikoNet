# EikoNet: A deep neural networking approach for seismic ray tracing
SeisRay is a software package that allows the training of a neural network that satisfies the Factored Eikonal 
for the computation of travel-time from any source-reciever pair in a user defined velocity model.

This approach is outline in greater detail in the publication: 
Smith et al. (2020) - EikoNet:A deep neural networking approach for seismic ray tracing.

Any additional question please contact: jsmith@caltech.edu

## Overview
The package is being developed in Python and also in a seperate Julia code. The current stages of development are as follows:\
Python - Fully operational with dependices given by the conda .yml file
Julia  - Currently being scripted, look back soon.

The software has yet to be built into a package format, we hope to complete this shortly.

## Notebooks
The folder Notebook gives a series of Notebooks that allow you to run the code for a series of 3D problems as outlined in the publication.
The code is commented to allow the user to understand the processing procedures.
