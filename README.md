# EikoNet: A deep neural networking approach for seismic ray tracing
EikoNet is a software package that allows the training of a neural network that satisfies the Factored Eikonal 
for the computation of travel-time from any source-reciever pair in a user defined velocity model.

This approach is outline in greater detail in the publication: 
Smith et al. (2020) - EikoNet:A deep neural networking approach for seismic ray tracing.

Code will be updated in the next couple of hours. Stay tunned .. 

Any additional question please contact: jsmith@caltech.edu

## Notebooks
The folder Notebook gives a series of Notebooks that allow you to run the code for the 3D problems as outlined in the publication.

The code is commented to allow the user to understand the processing procedures.
